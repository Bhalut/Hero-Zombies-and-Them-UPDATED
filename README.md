# Hero-Zombies-and-Them-UPDATED

## Description
This project contains "Parameters", "Arguments" and "Namespace". When an NPC is close to the Hero, a message is activated through the UI. NPCs inherit from a parent class where things are linked in common, such as states. Both the "Zombie" class and the "Citizen" class are in a library called "NPC" and the libraries are in that class, for the library "Zombie" the "Enemy" and for the library "Citizen" the "Ally". There will also be a counter to know the number of Zombies and Citizens, which will be printed from the Unity3D user interface in text form. And we, as players, are the hero (who receives the information).
The zombies will follow the "Citizen" and the "Hero", every touch of a citizen will turn it into a zombie and the counter will be reflected, and in case there is no citizen or a zombie touch the Hero, it is Game Over.
