# Hero-Zombies-and-Them-UPDATED

## Description
This project contains "Parameters", "Arguments" and "Namespace", for when a collision is detected, to obtain the information of the other classes.
Like the name and age of the citizen or, in the case of the zombie, the one he wants to eat from. In this case, for the zombie, one "Enum" is used for the states ("Idle", "Moving" or "Rotating") and another one for the tastes. Also in Zombie's Struct is the color of it.
Both the "Zombie" class and the "Citizen" class are in a library called'NPC' and libraries are in that class, for the "Zombie" the "Enemy" library and for the "Citizen" the "Ally" library.
There will also be a counter to know the number of Zombies and Citizens, which will be printed from the Unity3D UI in Text form.
And we as players are the Hero (who receives the information).
